C interface for the the Linux I2C driver.

<rc/i2c.h>

Developed and tested on the BeagleBone Black but should work fine on any Linux system.

Macros
#define 	I2C_MAX_BUS   5
 	Maximum I2C bus identifier. Default is 5 for a total of 6 busses. This can be increased by the user for special cases. More...
 
#define 	I2C_BUFFER_SIZE   128
 	size of i2c buffer in bytes for writing to registers. Only increase if you know what you are doing. More...

 	Sends exactly user-defined data without prepending a register address. More...
 
int 	rc_i2c_send_byte (int bus, uint8_t data)
 	Sends exactly user-defined data without prepending a register address. More...
 
int 	rc_i2c_lock_bus (int bus)
 	Locks the bus so other threads in the process know the bus is in use. More...
 
int 	rc_i2c_unlock_bus (int bus)
 	Unlocks a bus to indicate to other threads in the process that the bus is now free. More...
 
int 	rc_i2c_get_lock (int bus)
 	Fetches the current lock state of the bus. More...
 
int 	rc_i2c_get_fd (int bus)
 	Gets file descriptor. More...
